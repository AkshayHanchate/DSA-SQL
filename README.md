### DSA and SQL Practice
Welcome to the DSA and SQL Practice repository! üöÄ

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems that I have practiced to improve my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and SQL skills. It serves as a personal collection and reference for tackling a wide range of coding challenges.

**üìÇ Structure**
- Each solution is organized by:
- Topic: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- Difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard.
- Filename: Includes the problem name or ID for easy identification.

**üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies**
- Language: Python (primary) for DSA problems, SQL for database-related challenges.
- Platform: LeetCode.

**‚ú® Highlights**

DSA:
- Covers a variety of topics, including:
- Arrays, Strings, and Linked Lists.
- Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees.
- Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms.
- Graphs and Backtracking.
- Sliding Window, Two Pointers, and more!
- Optimized and clean solutions with comments for better understanding.
- Regular updates as I solve new problems.

SQL:

- Complex queries involving JOINs, subqueries, and window functions.
- Optimization techniques for efficient query performance.
- Real-world data manipulation and analysis scenarios.
- Optimized and clean solutions with comments for better understanding.

Regular updates as I solve new problems and explore additional topics.
